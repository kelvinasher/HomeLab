# HomeLab

I began working on this project 1/1/2025, at that point in time I only began researching and learning about various technologies and not yet implementing. 

The overarching point of this project is to learn more about the technologies that I've identified as "up and coming" that will further dominate the technology space in terms of administration, networking, data processing, hosting, ect. I want to learn more specifically about technologies like k8s, Linux, FluxCD, containerization, and some others. 

At the time of writing, my setup consists only of a laptop I got from my grandfather that has "OK" specs. On this laptop I have installed Ubuntu Server and k3s to start with.

At current, my goal is to establish an outward-facing web server that I can connect to anywhere, with some service running there. I am thinking perhaps a portfolio, or maybe a constructed demo-platform showing my homelab set up off in some way. I want to have a 'dashboard' that has all of my services, links, applications, ect on it that I can access from anywhere, ideally with some sort of file storage solution that I can access with a username and password from my phone (I do all work from my desktop and iPad, so if I am ever doing anything from my phone and I need those files I would not be able to access them without a cloud solution. Of course the solutions exist, but this sounds more fun.)

I have intermediate experience with networking, I am in school for network engineering and security and hope to take the skills I have and will further learn somewhere I can fully utilize them to solve challenging problems.

I have some Linux experience from my professional past, but not extensive enough to claim profiency.

I have very minor exposure to k8s, containerization.
